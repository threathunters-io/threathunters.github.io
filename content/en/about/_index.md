        <h1>Who we are?</h1>
        <p>Threathunters.io was initiated by the <b>Deutsche Bahn CSIRT</b> to create a robust community dedicated to detection engineering and incident response.</p>
        <p>We are a global community of voluntary incident responders and detection engineers who generously contribute their spare time to assist the security community with tools and practical knowledge. Our goal is to bolster the development of more effective detection and response capabilities.</p>
        <p>In addition to our primary focus on incident response and detection engineering, our community also delves into other pertinent topics, including general technical internals documentation. By adopting this comprehensive approach, we aim to foster a deeper understanding and broader knowledge base within the security community.</p>
